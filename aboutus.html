        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Here at Rocco, we have your best interest at heart. You're hungry? We have food. You need a stress-free environment? Our decor is clutter free, seats by windows if you prefer that, seats in the back if light is not your thing. We play soft classical music in the background, at a decent volume so you can talk to people without yelling, and it'll be comfortable if you prefer to eat in silence. We promise you only the very best when you step into our restaurant. We want it to be worth your money as much as you want it to be worth your money. Here at Ricco, we are all about you and your family. We are a family restaurant and no matter what, that will never change.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Founded in 1932 by our former CEO Antonio Rocco. Since the beginning, we have been commited to providing only the very best in service and food. It started as a dream. His father has a restaurant owned by his grandfather before him, but it was shut down due to bankruptsy. So, since a young age, all Antonio wanted was to bring back the restuarant his family loved. It took many years, a university degree, and a huge loan before this dream came to fruition. It was that love and dedication that has allowed our restaurant to become the well-loved place that it is today.</p>
        <h2>Present Day</h2>
        <p>Our current CEO is the son of our founder, Alexandre Rocco. He has inherited the passion that his father held, and he has succeeded in carrying on what is sure to be a family tradition that he will continue to pass on. We have more than 5 locations across Ontario now with plans to open even more. We are expanding to become the place that Antonio and his father wanted.</p>
